# Project Name: vizProf
## Team: Minci Zhou, Kaiwen Zhang, Dimitri Trofimuk, Xinyue Xiang.
It is a fully fledged web application that we did data collection and data visualization of the data we got from "rate my prof" for the web user.
## Main process of this Project
1. we wrote a web-spider to collect data from "ratemyprofessors.com" and got the data.
2. we did visualize using d3 etc.
3. made the html.
